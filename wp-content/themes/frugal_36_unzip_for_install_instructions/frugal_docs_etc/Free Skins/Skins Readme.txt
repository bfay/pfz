These are just a few skins to play with. This should give you an idea of what's possible with

this awesome new frugal feature set!

PLEASE NOTE!!: Be sure to always make a comlete export/backup of all your current frugal optoins

before attempting to import any frugal options/skins.  Just in case anything were to go wrong you'll

want to be sure you can restore your current settings at any time (though the 'frugal Snapshots'

option should help keep this from being an issue).

To install a skin:

1: Use the 'Skin Import' feature to 'Browse' for your Skin zip folder and then click 'Import Skin'.

That's IT!

Enjoy! :-)  Eric Hamm
