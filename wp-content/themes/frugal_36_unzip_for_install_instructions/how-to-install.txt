frugal
Version 3.5

***********************

Thanks for purchasing the frugal Premium Wordpress Theme!  I think you'll find it to be a

lite, clean, powerful Wordpress theme and it's my hope that it will soon become your favorite

option when choosing a skin for your Wordpress websites.


To install your frugal Theme you just upload the 'frugal_[version#]' folder to your 'themes'

directory in your Wordpress installation and then activate it from your Wordpress Dashboard.

I've also included a zipped version of this folder if you'd prefer to use the Wordpress

'Add New Themes' feature in which you can upload the zipped folder directly to Wordpress from

inside your Wordpress Dashboard.  So the files in the zipped folder are identical to those in

the un-zipped folder with the same name.



You'll find support for your frugal Theme at http://frugaltheme.com/support/  The video tutorials

provide the 'How-Tos' while the frugal Forum is the place for direct support as well as access to

the latest versions of frugal as they come out.


Enjoy!

The Frugal Team
