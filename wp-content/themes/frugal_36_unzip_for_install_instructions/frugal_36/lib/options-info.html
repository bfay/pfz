	<p><strong><font color="#444">Welcome to the frugal family! :-) The following is a little intro info to help you get started:</font></strong></p>
    <p>Before you really dig into your frugal Wordpress Theme be sure to take a look at all the frugal option pages and get acquainted with the
    many different features available to you. You can see that I've included [?] and [!] links next to many of these options. Just hover your mouse
    pointer over these links to see the info I provided for that particular setting. I tried to cover most of not so obvious options.</p>
	<p><b>NOTE: You can watch a video intro <a href="http://frugaltheme.com/support/tutorials/introduction-to-the-frugal-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</b></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">About Saving Changes...</font></strong></p>
    <p>A quick note about saving changes in frugal. Because frugal is setup to be cached by browsers you may not see saved changes until you delete
    your own browsers cache. The easiest way to do this is to just click the 'Refresh' button that is usually located next to your browser's address bar.
    The reason for all of this is to make your frugal website super fast and efficient. So when a new visitor comes to your site to look around your
    web server will only have to serve them the bulk of your site information once (at least until they clear their cache or a certain time period has
    elapsed. This makes it so much of your sites design is loaded into their browser and then accessed locally from their computer and therefore requires
    little use of your server after that initial visit. So it's all a good thing, but will require the occasional 'refresh' of your browser when making
    adjustments to your frugal Theme Options.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">CSS vs. PHP...</font></strong></p>
    <p>The CSS/PHP option may be a bit confusing so let me explain. The simple answer to the use of this option is that shouldn't touch it
    unless your style options aren't taking effect and you're unable to change the permissions of the 'dynamic.css' file on your server.</p>
    <p>There are two ways for your frugal Wordpress Theme to change its CSS settings. One is to hard code these updated settings to a CSS file
    called 'dynamic.css'. This is nice because it provides the web browsers of the people viewing your site the ability to completely cache
    your styles. This provides super fast and super efficient use of your site.</p>
    <p>The other way that frugal updates these options is to do so reading directly from the PHP file that computes these dynamic styles. Because
    these styles are all initiated and read with a PHP file there is no need for the file to be writable. So this is the option that will assure
    that your settings will change when you click that big, fat SAVE button (or the little guy I added to the bottom of your options pages). But
    because these styles are dynamically adjusted they are a bit less efficient than the CSS option, but only the slightest bit as this option is also
    cache-able by browsers, but in a different way. So either way you're going to have a fast, efficient website when frugal's at the helm. :-)</p>
	<p><strong><font color="#444">Margin And Padding Options...</font></strong></p>
	<p>Just in case you didn't know what areas pertain to what (eg. 10px 10px 10px 10px) as far as which number changed what setting (eg. top - right
	- bottom - left). It actually goes in that order. So the first px'd number pertains to the top, the second to the right, the third to the bottom
	and the fourth to the left. So it goes clockwise, starting from the top.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">SEO Options...</font></strong></p>
    <p>You'll find a wide array of SEO options to play with in frugal. You can do just about anything when it comes to adjusting these settings.
    One such thing is the ability to disable the In-Post/In-Page SEO options. I've provided this ability in case you're already using an SEO plugin
    that provides such a service and one that you want to stick with. This way you can still utilize all the other SEO options without stepping on the
    toes of your current SEO solution.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">The CMS Page Templates...</font></strong></p>
    <p>I've created CMS Page Templates to allow you the greatest CMS (Content Management System...aka...Full Blown Website Capability) capability.
    Now you create a page, select one of the CMS Page Templates and have independent control of those pages. What this means is that you can more
    effectively separate your blog from your 'website' and truly have a CMS platform. Your CMS page has it's own sidebars and sidebar display options, unique
    hooks as well as other specific options (like being able to exclude your category navbar only from that page, for example).</p>
    <p>You'll also note that I give you the ability to display your static homepage on the Blog Page Template. I do this so you can use that as your Blog
    homepage therefore giving you the ability to make one of your CMS pages the actual homepage of your website. Once again with the goal of allowing you
    full CMS capability with your frugal Wordpress Theme.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">Feature Options...(Custom Widgets)</font></strong></p>
    <p>One thing you'll find in the frugal Feature Options page is the ability to create custom widgets and functions and then hook them into any part of
	your website. This may be confusing to you at first, but over time you may want to play with these options so you can see what's possible. I'll be
	providing video tutorials to help make this more clear, but the simple explanation is that you can create content and display it in parts of your site
	that you would normally not have access to.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">Custom Files...</font></strong></p>
    <p>You'll also find two custom files that will help you if you're still in need of greater customization capability. First, you'll find a 'cutom.css'
    file located in the root directory of your frugal Wordpress Theme. You can easily add to and edit this file via the Wordpress 'Editor' under the
    'Appearance' section in your Wordpress Dashboard. By adding custom styles to this file you can override ALL other CSS settings in your theme.
    The other custom file is a 'custom_functions.php' file that is located in the /custom/ directory. You can add custom functions to this file as
    the need arises.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">The Master Reset Switch...</font></strong></p>
    <p>One of these options I want to explain further is the 'Master Reset Switch'. What this does is completely reset all your frugal theme
    options to their stock settings. I've included this option for two reasons. One, it can be a great way to 'fix' a broken theme. If for
    whatever reason your new settings conflict with those of a previous installation you can reset the theme to clean up your server database
    which usual solves most theme issues. Just keep in mind that you are WIPING your settings, so you'll have to re-add any changes you've made.</p>
    <p>The second use for this option is just being able to start from scratch when working on a new design. Kind of like balling up your paper and
    tossing it so you can grab a fresh sheet, this option allows you to wipe the slate clean so you begin the design process from the beginning.</p>
	<p><strong><font color="#444">Become An Affiliate...</font></strong></p>
	<p>Be sure to <a href="http://frugaltheme.com/affiliates" />Sign Up As A frugal Affiliate<a/> so you can add your affiliate link to your frugal
	footer link. This way when visitors like what they see and want to know where your theme came from they will 'tagged' as visitor from YOUR website.
	If a sale follows, you'll be credited for it and be entitled to a percentage of this sale. Pretty cool huh?! :-) Oh, and you can use your affiliate
	link to promote the frugal Wordpress Theme where you go. On Twitter, via email, advertisements, etc...</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#444">I could go on :-)...</font></strong></p>
    <p>There are many more things I could cover here, but I'll let you do a little exploring yourself. If you run into any confusion you can just pop over
    to the frugal support page for video tutorials, posts and a support forum. The bottom line is you have FULL CONTROL over your frugal Theme. From colors
    to font sizes to the many detailed settings the normally elude all but those who know how to dig into CSS and PHP code. So enjoy your frugal Theme and
    do awesome things with your online presence! frugal should be a good partner in this process and the future as this Wordpress Theme is only going to
    get better.</p>
